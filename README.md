#A Simple To-Do Service

This is a simple to-do service with a NodeJS backend.

There is no database integration (yet). Items are stored in-memory.

The frontend does not use any frameworks (yet), but follows a uni-directional data flow.

This example is part of the teaching materials for the http://fullstack101.xyz course

##Getting Started

```bash
#install gulp globally
npm install -g gulp

#install project dependencies
npm install

#build the frontend bundle
gulp

#run the server
node server/server.js
```
